# DaVinci Resolve Markers to YouTube Chapter times

## Goal
This repo is a simple Powershell script that takes in the .csv from Resolve's Marker output and pulls out only the 'Source In' and 'Notes' Columns, which are what I use to make YouTube Chapter timecodes for Video Descriptions

### Input:
All Files in \input-csv\
Resolve Marker Export .csv

### Output
.txt file with 'Source In' (with milliseconds cut out) and 'Notes' ready for easy Copy-Paste to your YouTube video description
